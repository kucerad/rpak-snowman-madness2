Simple Particle system for virtual reality system CAVE.

A semestral project in subject "Multimedia and Computer Animation" that implements a simple snowfight-like game demonstrating particle systems in 3D virtual reality environment CAVE.

The particles are the snowflakes that are falling down respecting basic physical laws.
The plot of the game is supernaive... There are always 3 snowmen in the field, you must shoot them with the snowball. No big deal. But the game never ends. You can shoot the as long as you wish and your score is counted. The snowmen cannot harm you, but it is not a comfortable feeling to be gone-through by them. So be quick, be attentive, be the winner!
